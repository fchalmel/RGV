<h3><i class="fab fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> Fork us</h3>
<p>	The web interface of TOXsIgN was built with two open web frameworks, <a href="https://trypyramid.com/" target="_blanck">Pyramid</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blanck">AngularJS</a>.
Pyramid embeds many features, such as a REST API, a JSON renderer, an SQLAlchemy Object-relational mapper (ORM), a Deform library to generate forms, and compatibility with SMTP servers.
AngularJS, on the other hand, is an open JavaScript framework that extends traditional HTML vocabulary; it allows implementation of readable and quickly developable web environments.</p>
The full source code of the ReproGenomics Viewer web application is available <a href="https://github.com/fchalmel/RGV">here</a>.

<h3><i class="fas fa-chart-bar" aria-hidden="true"></i> Data visualization</h3>
<p>All charts generated by RGV's tools use <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/">plotly.js plugin</a>. Built on top of <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> and <a href="http://stack.gl/">stack.gl</a>, 
plotly.js is a high-level, declarative charting library. plotly.js ships with 20 chart types, including 3D charts, statistical graphs, and SVG maps. </p>

<h3><i class="fab fa-superpowers" aria-hidden="true"></i> RGV backbone</h3>
<p>The backbone of the RGV is the series of tools for processing and organizing data within the system.
The system integrates an implementation of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27072794" target="_blanck">JBrowse</a> genome browser grafted to the RGV backbone.<br></p>
<p>Four types of information are manually extracted and curated for each study, including:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li>1- the scientific name of each species and the genome release with which the experiments were performed and analyzed;</li>
	<li>2- the associated scientific publication;</li>
	<li>3- each biology topic investigated in the study;</li>
	<li>4- and the high-throughput technologies performed. Then each raw data file of a given data set underwent a series of automatic processing to make it fully compatible with the RGV system.</li>
</ul>

<h3><i class="fas fa-flask" aria-hidden="true"></i> Sample Procesing</h3>
<p>For each sample, eight processing steps are sequentially performed:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
	<li>1- The raw data file (sra file) of a given sample and their associated information are downloaded from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" target="_blanck">Gene Expression Omnibus</a> (GEO) and to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra" target="_blanck">Sequence Read Archive</a> (SRA);</li>
	<li>2- The fastq file is extracted from the sra archive file;</li>
	<li>3- reads are mapped on its corresponding reference genome using the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23104886" target="_blanck">STAR</a> tool.</li>
	<li>4- each bam file is converted into a simple tab-delimited text file (BED) in which data are standardized according to the total nuber of read counts using <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20110278" target="_blanck">BEDTools</a>;</li>
	<li>5- the standardized BED file is then converted into an indexed binary format (bigWig or bw) to enable fast remote access to the data;</li>
	<li>6- the pairwise alignments between genome assemblies and between species provided by UCSC made it possible to convert genome coordinates in the resulting bigWig file from a genome of a given species into a genome of another species ussing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24351709" target="_blanck">CrossMap</a>.</li>
	<li>7- reference transcripts are quantified in the corresponding sample using the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690850" target="_blanck">StringTie</a> tool.</li>
	<li>8- We used manually extracted information to organize the processed data into four broad categories, i.e. biological topics, technologies, publications and species.</li>
</ul>
